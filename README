Version 1.2: 2012-06-14

This is the README file for the LaTeX source code to produce the PDF file
trigbook.pdf. Compilation uses plain latex (not pdflatex) to convert the
LaTeX source files to dvi, dvips to convert the dvi file to PostScript, and
ps2pdf to convert from PostScript to PDF.

You will need a number of packages in order to compile the code. Look
through the preamble in the trigbook.tex file to see all the package names in
the "\usepackage" commands at the top of the file.
Most of these will probably already be installed if you have a reasonably
up-to-date LaTeX system installed. If not, you should install the latest
versions of those packages. In particular, you should use the latest
version of the TikZ graphics package (at least version 2.0).
Other nonstandard packages you will need are picins and the Phaistos and
Beramono fonts, which can be found at CTAN (http://www.ctan.org).

The source code was successfully compiled using TeX Live 2011 in Fedora 17,
though a number of individual packages (such as TikZ) were
manually updated and others had to be installed because they were not present
originally. So if compilation fails for you, then install the latest packages
as much as possible.

A bash script called trigbook.sh is included to automate the creation of
the PDF file in Linux/UNIX systems. Run it like this:

./trigbook.sh

If you are running some version of Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X, well,
you're on your own as far as compiling, as I don't use those platforms. :)
In general, the instructions given above are the extent of whatever
assistance I can provide with compilation in any operating system.
